# TASK OVERVIEW
# Array Operations in JavaScript

This repository contains JavaScript code examples for various array operations, with a focus on using built-in functions. Each program is designed to solve a specific problem related to array manipulation.

## Programs

### a. Print Odd Numbers in an Array

This program uses the `filter` function to print odd numbers from an array.

### b. Convert Strings to Title Caps in a String Array

This program utilizes the `map` function to convert all strings to title caps in a string array.

### c. Sum of All Numbers in an Array

This program calculates the sum of all numbers in an array using the `reduce` function.

### d. Return Prime Numbers in an Array

The program uses the `filter` function to return all prime numbers in an array.

### e. Return Palindromes in an Array

This program identifies and returns all palindromes in a string array using the `filter` function.

### f. Return Median of Two Sorted Arrays

The median of two sorted arrays is computed efficiently without sorting the merged array. It uses the `concat` method for merging and basic arithmetic for finding the median.

### g. Remove Duplicates from an Array

This program removes duplicates from an array using the `Set` data structure.

### h. Rotate an Array by K Times

The array rotation is performed by slicing the array without using the spread operator.

## Built-in Functions Used

- `filter`: Used to filter elements based on a condition.
- `map`: Used to transform each element of an array.
- `reduce`: Used to accumulate values into a single result.
- `concat`: Used to merge arrays.
- `Set`: Used to remove duplicates efficiently.
- Basic arithmetic operations: Used for finding the median and rotating an array.
